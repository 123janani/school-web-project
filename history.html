	The first school at Ginigathhena was started in <b>Ginigathhena Town </b>Mahakade in about <b>1913</b>.
	From the beginning this school imparted knowledge attitudes and aptitudes to students in the area.
	A gentleman named <b>Gelioya Samarasinghe </b>functioned as the head Master. It is stated that an assistant teacher named E.P. Rupasinghe served in this school 
	and due to the increase of number of students the school was shifted to the place where the present Primary School is situated. It is stated that the new 
	premises is a donation of a lady named <b>Akkara Arachchige Lama Ethana</b>. <b>Mr. K.M. Herath Mudalihamy functioned as the First Principal of this school.</b>
	Facts revealed that the school was carried out with <b>25</b> students and with the assistance of our teachers and with the guidance of a gentleman named K.M. Herath
	Mudalihamy. Thereafter as a result of increase in the number of students the staff was increased to thirteen and a Principal named Mr. P.B. Herath has served
	in the year 1915. <br>The credit of converting this school as a complete school after 1915 goes to Mr. Ellepola H.M. Somarathna. Most people say that this period 
	was a very important period as during this period the school developed qualitatively. Inhabitants in the area say that the assistance of many were received by
	Provincial VIPs, like Mr. D.B. Rajapaksha (Dr), Mr. G.W. Gunapala, Mr. G.D. Dayarthna, Mr. P. Senanayake for the achievement of spiritual development. 
	The facility of studying English and Tamil were also there. The first scholarship holder of the school and received university education facilities was 
	selected as the first Teacher Trainee and this is reported as a special incident now. An organization was formed namely Educational Assistance Committee on
	the Presidentship of Mr. D.B. Rajapaksha aiming progress of the school. Mr. E.L. Dissanayake functioned as the Treasurer of this committee. It is reported that
	there were 900 at the time and as a result of implementation of C.W.W. Kannangara Reorganization Proposals in the year 1945 this school was converted to a 
	Central College. <br>Due to increase in the number of students and due to development of the school the space area was not sufficient. Therefore an extent of 
	5.5 acres were purchased from the land called Dalinawatta (Delhenawatta) situated at Ginigathhena with the assistance of the Education Assistance Committee 
	and 6 halls were constructed and the Senior Section was shifted to the new building. Mr. H.M. Somarathna functioned as the Principal during this period. 
	Due to offering him a post as a Lecturer of Training College Mr. T.M. Jayasekara functioned as the Principal. Providing hostel facilities to students the 
	Boys Hostel was shifted to Thiniyagala area (presently the House known as the Boarding) Girls Hostel was carried out in the house of T.A. Perera Mudalali.
	The natural calamity affected the country during 1947 affected Ginigathhena Diyanilla area too. As a result of it a necessity arose to shift the school to
	another safe area. But as a result of effort of Aid Committee it was recommended to keep the school in the same place and that has been a blessing to the 
	school children of the area. Thereafter a Principal named Rajakariyar was appointed to the school. He has contributed his efforts to make this school as a 
	complete <b>Central College</b>. At this time the post of Principal was vacant.<br> In 1946 Mr. J.T. Pieris came as new Principal. He contributed his services showing 
	the progress achieved as a new period. After Mr. J.T Pieris who was praised by the inhabitants and children Mr. Charlis Godage came as Principal in 1953. 
	He was a very kind hearted person and he contributed his efforts to improve the condition of the school. His services lasted only for a short period and 
	Mr. J.D.S. Badugodahewa assumed duties as Principal in 1955. He fulfilled his services bringing a progress to school for a period of 3 years. At the end 
	of this era Mr. C. Ranhoti came as the Principal in 1958 and took action to improve the condition of the school. Mr. Wilson Bandaranayake who had a pleasant
	look won the good will of not only the students but also the parents. He devoted his time in the task of developing the school getting the assistance of 
	officers and politicians in the area. Thereafter Mr. P. Tennakoon assumed duties as the Principal in 1964. After two years in 1965 Mr. W.D.A.D. Soysa 
	assumed duties as Principal. His services ended after in one year. Mr. N.S. Amarasinghe assumed duties as the Principal in 1968. Thereafter the post of 
	Principal was held by Mr. Victor Wijekoon in 1969. <br>In the year 1970 Mr. A.T.D. Dharmarathna provided his services for one year. In the year 1971 
	Mr. K.M.C. Kuruppu held the post of Principal. Since Mr. Thilakasiri Gilbert came to this school as the Principal in 1972 a new era was started. 
	Physical and Human Resources developed in this time as a result the school could produced doctors and engineers. A Shrine Room was also built during this
	period and this has been a blessing to school. The next principal was Mr. G.D. Dharmasena. His services started in 1977. He organized School Prefect and 
	Teacher Service Appreciation Scheme and by initiating practical development, field tours also started. Thereafter Mr. B.M. Rathnapala assumed duties of 
	Principal in 1985. He contributed his services for the upliftment of the school for one year. He administered the school developing physical and human 
	resources of the school and providing a complete education to the children and showing the talents of a good principal. Most believe the service of the 
	school in this period has based with the principal humanism. Thereafter the post of the Principal was held by Mr. D.M. Dissanayake. At the end of his 
	services which lasted for a short time ended and Mr. D.M. Ranbanda, an old pupil of the school and the first graduate of the school was appointed to the
	post of Principal. Under his guidance the 50 years <b>Silver Jubilee</b> of the school was organized and held. Educational Carnivals and Exhibitions were held 
	under his guidance. <br>With the arrival of Mr. P.G. Saranaraja Banda in 1995 as Principal of the school, started to march towards a new era. He contributed
	his services to the school bringing the school forward and helping children to develop their aptitudes. Thereafter Mr. M.P. Mandanayake came as Principal
	in the year 2000. A Media Unit was started to develop Mass Media talents of children. He passed away unexpectedly and lost his services to the nation. His 
	name is remembered for ever. Since the demise of Mr. M.P. Mandanayake Mr. R.S. Senarathna assumed duties as Principal in 2002. He started work with dedication
	to develop teaching and subject and related activities and extra curricular activities of the school. A Computer Training Centre also started and Old Pupils 
	Association which has not functioned for a considerable period convened by him and the credit goes to him. The special projects were introduced for Advanced 
	Level students and Subjects Related Camps and Student Vocational Guidance were organized. We wish our mother school can produce intelligent students for the 
	future like done for the sixty years past achieved by her.
